# CLImate
This simple weather app 'CLImate' marks the start of my venture into meteorology

![Concept](https://github.com/zencane/cliMATE/assets/141449041/8e9c4a8c-d9a8-4685-a5fb-c60832a6ea31)

#### Next steps
- Host site on something other than Github since it does not appear properly in Github Pages.
- Change background and orbs hue depending on the temperature (white for below zero, red for 30 Celcius degrees+)
- Add animations 

##### API Used
